# Command Reference for mktree

## mktree

`mktree` is a pretty straightforward cli. All you have to do is to call it on the directory which you want the boilerplate to be created and specify a file containing the structure to be replicated.

Combined with a simple templating system (provided by the `--var foo=bar` option), you can build great and complex structures with ease.
